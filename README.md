## Intro to ScalaLoci
This site serves as an introduction into [ScalaLoci](https://scala-loci.github.io/) and the concepts behind it. ScalaLoci is a multi-tier distributed programming language based on Scala. It allows users to write distributed applications as if they were one single application. ScalaLoci automatically splits your code across the different compile targets (currently JVM applications as well as JavaScript web-applications are supported) and takes care of the networking logic.

This documentation is available at [https://scala-loci.github.io/doc/](https://scala-loci.github.io/doc/).

To get started using ScalaLoci, have a look at the [Getting Started](howtos/getting_started) section or look at one of the example applications on [Github](https://github.com/scala-loci/examples-simple).
